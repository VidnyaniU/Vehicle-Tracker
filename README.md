The proposed project is a real-time vehicle tracking and route-sharing application that enables users to simultaneously track the live positions of two vehicles on a map as they navigate toward a shared destination. The app provides dynamic route directions similar to Google Maps while displaying the relative position of both vehicles in real time, enhancing coordination and navigation efficiency.
